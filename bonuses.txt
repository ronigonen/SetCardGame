BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

1. We used all the configuration properties instead of magic numbers.
2. It was used in the class Player:
    -In the Ai thread where we used the tableSize to random a number.
    -In the run method where we checked the amount of actions/slots using featureSize.
    -In the penalty and point functions where we used the freeze times.
   It was used in the class Dealer:
    -In order to update the timer display using the turnTimeOutMillies.
    -In the placeCardsOnTable, and removeAllCardsFromTable in order to run on all slots in the game using tableSize.
    -In the announceWinner method before the game ends, pauses for endGamePauseMillies.
   It was used in the class Table:
    -In order to set the tableSize.
    -In order to set the number of players.
    -In order to set the deckSize.
    -In the placeCard and removeCard methods in order to pause for tableDelayMillies.
3. We checked that there is no additional magic numbers, and we changed the config.properties and checked that it works correspondingly to it.
--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

1. In the function terminate in the class Dealer we terminated the players by the opposite order of creating them
   (while creating the player threads it creates them from index 0 to the number of players, and while terminating them it terminates from the last player to the first).
2. It was used in the Dealer class (as it was mentioned in answer 1.).
3. While debugging, we saw that it terminates the last player first.
--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

We are not entitled to this bonus.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
